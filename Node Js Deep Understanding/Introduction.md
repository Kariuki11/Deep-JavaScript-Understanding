## **NODE JS INTRODUCTION**




1. **Node.js** is an open-source, cross-platform **JavaScript runtime** built on **Chrome's V8 engine**.

2. It runs **JavaScript outside the browser**, enabling backend development with JS.

3. **Single-threaded, non-blocking** I/O model using **asynchronous callbacks** for performance and scalability.

4. Handles **thousands of concurrent connections** efficiently without multi-threading.

5. Uses **event-driven architecture**, making it ideal for I/O-heavy applications like web servers and APIs.

6. Frontend developers can use their **JavaScript skills on the server-side** as well.

7. Supports **modern ECMAScript features**, configurable via Node.js version or flags.

8. Built-in `http` module lets you create web servers with methods like `createServer()`.

9. In a basic HTTP server:

   * `req` (request) contains request data.
   * `res` (response) is used to send back the response.

10. Key response methods:

    * `res.statusCode = 200`: Sets response status.
    * `res.setHeader(...)`: Sets response headers.
    * `res.end(...)`: Ends and sends the response.

11. To run a Node.js app:
    Save as `server.js` and run with `node server.js` in the terminal.
