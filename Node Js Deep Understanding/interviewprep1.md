# WHAT IS NODE.JS AND WHAT ARE ITS ADVANTAGES

Node.js is an open-source, cross-platform JavaScript runtime environment that allows you to run JavaScript code outside of a web browser—most commonly on the server side.
It’s built on Google’s V8 JavaScript engine (the same one used in Chrome) and uses an event-driven, non-blocking I/O model, which makes it lightweight and efficient, especially for data-intensive, real-time applications.
