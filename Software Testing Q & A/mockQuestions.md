# SOME TECHNICAL QUESTIONS THAT ARE COMMON IN A Q&A INTERVIEW.

1. **How would you test cross-currency wallet transactions.**
        - To test cross-currency wallet transactions,
         I would take a layered approach covering functional correctness, data integrity, security, UI consistency, and error handling — both manually and via automation where possible.

2. **What security test cases would you design for login and wallet authorization flows?**
        - For a fintech app handling sensitive wallet and identity data — I’d design a comprehensive set of security test cases to validate login and wallet authorization, covering authentication, 
        session handling, data protection, and attack prevention.

3. **3. How would you perform UI testing for the virtual card issuance flow on mobile and web?**
        - To test the virtual card issuance flow on mobile and web, 
        I would design a mix of functional, usability, and cross-platform UI tests — both manually and with automation — to ensure users can smoothly create a virtual card and view it securely.

4. **4. Describe how you would verify integration with external APIs (e.g. MoneyGram, banking API, crypto minting).**
        - To verify integration with external APIs like MoneyGram, banking systems, or crypto minting services, 
        I would design a mix of functional, contract, reliability, and security tests — ensuring the app interacts with third parties accurately, safely, and under various conditions.
5. **How would you design a stress/load testing scenario for payment remittance during high‑traffic spikes?**
        - To design a stress and load testing scenario for payment remittance, especially during traffic spikes (like Black Friday or salary days), 
        I would simulate high-volume transactions under controlled environments using realistic data, measure system performance, and identify breaking points to ensure the platform remains stable and reliable under pressure.
