## **Software Testing**


Software Testing is a method to check whether the actual software product matches expected requirements and to ensure that software product is Defect free. It involves execution of software/system components using manual or automated tools to evaluate one or more properties of interest. The purpose of software testing is to identify errors, gaps or missing requirements in contrast to actual requirements.

**Why Software Testing is Important?**

Software Testing is Important because if there are any bugs or errors in the software, it can be identified early and can be solved before delivery of the software product. Properly tested software product ensures reliability, security and high performance which further results in time saving, cost effectiveness and customer satisfaction.

**What are the benefits of Software Testing?**

*Cost-Effective:* It is one of the important advantages of software testing. Testing any IT project on time helps you to save your money for the long term. In case if the bugs caught in the earlier stage of software testing, it costs less to fix.

*Security:* It is the most vulnerable and sensitive benefit of software testing. People are looking for trusted products. It helps in removing risks and problems earlier.

*Product quality:* It is an essential requirement of any software product. Testing ensures a quality product is delivered to customers.

*Customer Satisfaction:* The main aim of any product is to give satisfaction to their customers. UI/UX Testing ensures the best user experience.

**Testing in Software Engineering**  - As per ANSI/IEEE 1059, Testing in Software Engineering is a process of evaluating a software product to find whether the current software product meets the required conditions or not. The testing process involves evaluating the features of the software product for requirements in terms of any missing requirements, bugs or errors, security, reliability and performance.

**Types of Software Testing**

Typically Testing is classified into three categories.

1. Functional Testing
2. Non-Functional Testing or Performance Testing
3. Maintenance (Regression and Maintenance)


**1. Functional Testing**  -  Checks if the system does what it's supposed to do, based on requirements (e.g. login works, form submits).

            Unit Testing  - Tests individual pieces of code (like functions or methods) in isolation. Done by developers.

            Integration Testing  - Tests how different parts/modules work together, like database + API + frontend.

            Smoke - A quick test to check if the core functions of the app work (e.g., app launches, API is reachable). Like a sanity check.

            UAT ( User Acceptance Testing) - Final testing by the actual users or clients to see if the software meets their needs.

            Localization - Tests if the app works correctly in a specific language, region, or culture (like currency or date format in Kenya).

            Globalization - Ensures the app can be used in multiple countries/languages without breaking (language switching, encoding).

            Interoperability - Checks if the system works well with other systems or software (e.g., integrates with PayPal or external APIs).

            Sanity Testing - A quick check to see if a specific bug is fixed and nothing major is broken after that fix.

            Performance Testing - Measures how fast and stable the system is under load (e.g., 1000 users login at once).

            Security Testing - Checks if the system is protected against attacks, data leaks, unauthorized access, etc.

**2. Non Functional Testing**  - Non-Functional Testing checks how well the system performs rather than what it does.

It focuses on things like speed, usability, reliability, and capacity â€” not the actual features.
