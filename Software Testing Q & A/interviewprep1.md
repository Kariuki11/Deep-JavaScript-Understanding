**29. What is Test Strategy?**
A **high-level document** outlining the overall testing approach, objectives, and principles for a project.

---

**30. What is Test Data?**
The **input data** used for executing test cases (both valid and invalid).

---

**31. What is Defect Life Cycle?**
The process a defect goes through from **identification â†’ fixing â†’ retesting â†’ closure**.

---

**32. What is Severity vs Priority in a Bug?**

* **Severity:** How badly the bug affects the system (technical impact).
* **Priority:** How quickly the bug should be fixed (business impact).
