# ‚úÖ 30 QA Interview Questions & Answers (Beginner ‚Üí Expert)

---

## üîπ Beginner Level (1‚Äì10)

**1. What is Quality Assurance (QA)?**
QA ensures that the software meets the required quality standards by **preventing defects** during the software development process. It focuses on **process-oriented** activities.

---

**2. What is the difference between QA and QC?**

* **QA (Quality Assurance):** Process-focused, prevents defects.
* **QC (Quality Control):** Product-focused, finds defects after development.

---

**3. What is the difference between Verification and Validation?**

* **Verification:** Checks if the product is built **according to requirements** (are we building it right?).
* **Validation:** Ensures the product **meets the user‚Äôs needs** (are we building the right thing?).

---

**4. What is a Test Case?**
A **test case** is a set of conditions, steps, and expected results created to validate a specific functionality of the software.

---

**5. What is the difference between a Test Case and a Test Scenario?**

* **Test Case:** Step-by-step instructions with expected results.
* **Test Scenario:** High-level description of what to test (end-to-end flow).

---

**6. What is a Bug, Defect, and Error?**

* **Error:** Mistake by a developer.
* **Defect:** Flaw in the application found during testing.
* **Bug:** Defect accepted by developers as a problem to be fixed.

---

**7. What is Regression Testing?**
Regression testing checks if **new code changes** break or affect existing functionality.

---

**8. What is Smoke Testing?**
Smoke testing is a **basic test** to check if the application‚Äôs core functionalities work before deeper testing.

---

**9. What is Sanity Testing?**
Sanity testing ensures **specific bug fixes or new features** work correctly without testing everything.

---

**10. What are Functional and Non-Functional Testing?**

* **Functional:** Tests features (login, payment).
* **Non-Functional:** Tests performance, security, usability, scalability.

---

## üîπ Intermediate Level (11‚Äì20)

**11. What is the Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC)?**
The SDLC is the process of **planning, developing, testing, deploying, and maintaining** software.

---

**12. What is the Software Testing Life Cycle (STLC)?**
The STLC includes:

1. Requirement Analysis
2. Test Planning
3. Test Case Development
4. Test Environment Setup
5. Test Execution
6. Test Closure

---

**13. What is Agile Testing?**
Agile testing follows the **Agile methodology**, where testing is done continuously in sprints, and QA collaborates closely with developers and product owners.

---

**14. What is the difference between Manual Testing and Automation Testing?**

* **Manual:** Human testers execute test cases.
* **Automation:** Uses tools (Selenium, Playwright, Cypress) to run tests automatically.

---

**15. What is Black Box Testing vs White Box Testing?**

* **Black Box:** Tests functionality without knowing code.
* **White Box:** Tests internal code, logic, and structures.

---

**16. What are Test Deliverables?**
Artifacts provided during the testing process, such as Test Plan, Test Cases, Bug Reports, and Test Summary Reports.

---

**17. What is a Test Plan?**
A Test Plan is a **document outlining testing strategy, objectives, scope, schedule, resources, and deliverables**.

---

**18. What is a Test Strategy?**
A **high-level document** defining the overall testing approach, tools, levels of testing, and responsibilities.

---

**19. What is Boundary Value Analysis (BVA)?**
BVA tests input values at the **boundaries** (e.g., if input range is 1‚Äì100, test 0, 1, 100, 101).

---

**20. What is Equivalence Partitioning?**
It divides input data into **valid and invalid partitions** to reduce test cases (e.g., input 1‚Äì100 ‚Üí partitions: <1, 1‚Äì100, >100).

---

## üîπ Expert Level (21‚Äì30)

**21. What is Continuous Testing in DevOps?**
Continuous Testing means integrating automated tests into the **CI/CD pipeline** to ensure rapid feedback.

---

**22. What is Test Automation Framework?**
A structured set of **guidelines, tools, and libraries** used to create and maintain automated test scripts (e.g., Data-Driven, Hybrid, Page Object Model).

---

**23. How do you prioritize test cases?**

* Business impact
* Risk & probability of failure
* Frequency of use
* Critical functionalities

---

**24. What is Risk-Based Testing?**
Testing is prioritized based on **risk impact and likelihood** (high-risk features get tested first).

---

**25. What are Mocking and Stubbing in QA?**

* **Mocking:** Creating fake objects to test dependencies.
* **Stubbing:** Providing predefined responses for method calls.

---

**26. How do you ensure quality in Agile projects?**

* Test early and continuously
* Collaborate with developers and product owners
* Use automation for regression
* Conduct frequent reviews & retrospectives

---

**27. What is Exploratory Testing?**
Unscripted, simultaneous learning, test design, and execution to discover defects not covered by formal test cases.

---

**28. How do you handle flaky tests in Automation?**

* Stabilize test environment
* Add proper waits
* Improve test data management
* Re-run failed tests selectively

---

**29. What is the difference between Load Testing, Stress Testing, and Endurance Testing?**

* **Load:** Test system under expected load.
* **Stress:** Test beyond normal load until failure.
* **Endurance (Soak):** Test under load for a long time to check stability.

---

**30. How do you measure software quality?**
Metrics:

* Defect Density
* Test Coverage
* Mean Time to Failure (MTTF)
* Customer Satisfaction
* Code Quality metrics (SonarQube)

---

üî• These 30 cover **beginner ‚Üí expert progression**.

Would you like me to also create a **cheat sheet table (Q\&A in one line for quick review before interviews)** so you can revise faster?
